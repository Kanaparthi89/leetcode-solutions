Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the smallest positive multiple of k that is missing from nums.

A multiple of k is any positive integer divisible by k.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [8,2,3,4,6], k = 2

Output: 10

Explanation:

The multiples of k = 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12... and the smallest multiple missing from nums is 10.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,4,7,10,15], k = 5

Output: 5

Explanation:

The multiples of k = 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20... and the smallest multiple missing from nums is 5.

Constraints:


	1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100
	1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100
	1 &lt;= k &lt;= 100
